          <h2>How can you help?</h2>

          <p>
            You can contribute your time and skills by supporting specific ongoing 
            projects or by assisting in our broader organizational efforts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our volunteers and interns actively engage in a variety of initiatives, 
            including managing scholarship programs, mentoring students across 
            primary, secondary, undergraduate, and graduate levels, and delivering 
            guest lectures at educational institutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, volunteers support outreach initiatives, enhance our 
            digital presence, conduct research and field studies, and contribute 
            to fundraising efforts that sustain our mission.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are always open to fresh ideas and innovative approaches. If you have 
            a vision or initiative you would like to contribute, we would love to 
            hear from you.
