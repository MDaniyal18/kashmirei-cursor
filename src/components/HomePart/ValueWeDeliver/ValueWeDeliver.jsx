          At KEI, we walk alongside every scholar — from their first classroom to their first career milestone.
          Through a holistic ecosystem of support, we provide financial scholarships, dedicated mentorship,
          digital learning tools, and hands-on career experiences. Our eight programs — spanning High School
          S, Career Awareness, Mentorship, Experiential Learning, Gooru Navigator, Digital Smart
          Learning, International Bridge Scholarship, and Graduate Abroad — work together to ensure no gifted
          student in Kashmir is held back by circumstance.
